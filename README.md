# Classy Compiler
Professor Labouseur, please grade the branch titled "Project1". 

I explained some of the flaws in the commit descriptions when testing the sample programs. Everything is still recognized by the grammar, so I am content with submitting this despite a few minor flaws. These will be fixed ASAP. Please run the CCMain.java file and the corresponding sampleProgram txt files. Thank you!

This is my repository where I will be designing and building a compiler for the class CMPT432.

I will be using Java as my programming language.

Testing will be achieved with the compilation command
  > javac CCMain.java 

Input will be taken as a command line parameter, e.g.,
  > java mainFileName sampleProgram(s).txt

and write output to standard out.
