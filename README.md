# Classy Compiler
Professor Labouseur, please grade the branch titled "Project2". 

I have created several test cases, please feel free to run through them all. 

Files named testA#.txt will pass parse and create a concrete syntax tree, unless otherwise stated in the comments of the text file. In some cases, I added a test program that would not pass parse to show the relationship between the other programs within (testA5.txt for example). In testA2.txt I added a program identical to the one's before and after it, yet the CST displays incorrectly. I am unsure why this is, and I noted this in the comments in the file. This is the only known error I am aware of in terms of building CST's.

Files named testF#.txt will not pass parse and therefore will not display a CST.

Thank you!
