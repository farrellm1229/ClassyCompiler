# Classy Compiler
This is my repository where I will be designing and building a compiler for the class CMPT432.

I will be using Java as my programming language.

Testing will be achieved with the compilation command
  > javac mainFileName 

and the run command
  > java mainFileName

Input will be taken as a command line parameter, e.g.,
  > java mainFileName sampleProgram(s).txt

and write output to standard out.
