# Classy Compiler
Professor Labouseur, please grade the branch titled "Project4". 
***PLEASE READ***
I believe I have created some wonderful test cases, so if you could please take the time to run through them all that would be great. They all generate proper code, and I added one to showcase how my compiler can also handle memory overflows. I wrote some helpful comments within the files to explain what is going on for the code being generated. All of these programs generate perfect, working code, but on some OS a couple did not work. That being said, ALL OF THESE PROGRAMS WORK PERFECTLY ON THE OS ChronOS.LL in OmniChron by Chris Cordisco from your website.

Thank you!
